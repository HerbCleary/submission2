# Designing a website for a small independent mobile phone company

# Stakeholders

    What Is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a business or enterprise and can either affect or be affected by the business.

Typical stakeholders are investors, employees, customers, suppliers, communities, governments, or trade associations.

An entity's stakeholder(s) can be both internal or external to the organization.

    The different types of stakeholders

Info is pretty conflicting on exactly how many types of stakeholders there are but here i've melted them all down to their base 4 categories to make things easier.

+ Users
+ Providers
+ Influencer's
+ Governance

These four categories of stakeholder-y-ness villainy make the acronym UPIG. Do what you will with this information idk.

I mean really look at this shit. Idk man.

# Colours

A good website needs a good colour palette.

To come up with a good colour scheme for this website I took a look at what other websites used most often and also had a look at some colour palettes others had made online.

## What others used

These examples are colours used by various websites including:

+ ee
+ Samsung
+ Buy mobiles
+ Ebay
+ Amazon

## My own ideas

When looking at a palette I liked I took inspiration from a few different things including self preference.

 In the end I settled on the following two palettes:<br>

 One consisting of mixed blues and greens as they make a nice chill ocean-y kind of mix that I've seen a few times on websites like Samsung and Buy mobiles which sell products that the website I am aiming to create will be selling.<br>

 The other mix consists of a lot of golds and browns alike to amazon and sand. I dunno man I just picked em cause I liked em.<br>

 In the end I decided i'm going to go with the first palette as I liked it more than the other.

# Test plan

Things that need to be tested and checked to make sure the website is working alright.

+ Make sure the page links work properly (Navigation from home to phones and so on from each page)
+ Test the web sizes are correct/look alright
+ Get feedback from colleagues

# Testing

+ ## Chrome
  - I started off with chrome and loaded the website. Initially no issues to start.
  <br> <img src="img/chrome1.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="420px"/><br>
  - I tested the page at varying widths and found that the main text and image for the banner would seem to break with its text wrapping. Alongside that when switching pages there seemed to be an odd bug where the size of the box would readjust wrong and result in a dark grey bar at the bottom of the carousel. 
  <br> <img src="img/chrome2.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="300px"/> <img src="img/chrome3.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="300px"/><br>
  - Moving on I tested the page links and all were responsive and worked when traversing between pages. Similarly so I tested my other pages by altering the window width to see if any bugs occurred like the first page and they seemed to have no issue.
  <br> <img src="img/chrome4.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="420px"/> <img src="img/chrome5.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="300px"/><img src="img/chrome6.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="300px"/><br>
  All the links between 'Home', 'Top Deals', 'Phones' and 'About' alongside that the links on the carousel to the individual phones and the links to phones in 'Top Deals' & 'Phones' sections of the website also worked just fine with no issue.

#

+ ## Firefox

  - Moving on I then repeated the steps used to test Chrome with Firefox.
    <img src="img/firefox1.png" alt="drawing" height="270px" width="420px"/></br>
    Quickly I found that there were very few differences to the issues I was having on Chrome. 
    
    The only difference I noticed was that the pages loaded slightly faster on Firefox compared to Chrome.
